Description: 
pols_data.csv has 822 rows × 9 columns (year 1947-2015) with monthly counts of officeholders by party: gov_gop, sen_gop, rep_gop, gov_dem, sen_dem, rep_dem, plus the president variable indicates whether the president was democratic or republican on the associated date (dem = democratic; gop = republican). snp_data.csv has 787 × 3 (year 1950–2015) with year, month, close (the closing values of the S&P stock index). unemployment_data.csv has 816 × 3 (year 1948–2015) with year, month, unemployment (percentage of unemployment on the associate date). After merging all data sets, merged_data.csv contains 822 rows × 11 columns, spanning 1947–2015. Key variables are year, month, gov_gop, sen_gop, rep_gop, gov_dem, sen_dem, rep_dem, president, close, and unemployment (%).
